# Questions

This attempt follows the example design as closely as possible, utilizing a wide range of techniques. 

I was unsure if the project was to follow the designs given or to come up with a complete revamp of the design, so I just followed the design images given.

**Improvements:**
The given design contained a few UI flaws that makes the final version seem buggy, which I have also included to make it as accurate as possible to the design. I tested primary on iPhone 11 and the iPhone 14 Pro Max for resolution changes and the screen adapts where it seems to adapt well to the different screen resolutions.

**Revamping the design**
- Colour scheme (Check boxes, tab bar)
- Preview on how many topics have been covered within each lecture (e.g 3/14)
- Simplifying the UI to improve compatibility throughout the devices
- Adding a tick in replacement of the time once all topics have been ticked off/ turning home screen cell green
